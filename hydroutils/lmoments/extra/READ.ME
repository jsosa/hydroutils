FORTRAN ROUTINES FOR USE WITH THE METHOD OF L-MOMENTS --- VERSION 3.04
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This library contains 56 routines for statistical analysis using L-moments,
and some auxiliary routines used by the L-moment routines.  L-moments are
measures of location, scale and shape of probability distributions, similar
to the ordinary moments but estimable from linear combinations of order
statistics.  For further information refer to the following publications.

ROUTINES FOR SPECIFIC DISTRIBUTIONS
-----------------------------------

The following routines are provided for each of eleven distributions.

FUNCTION CDFxxx     The cumulative distribution function of the distribution.

FUNCTION QUAxxx     The quantile function (inverse cumulative distribution
                    function) of the distribution.

SUBROUTINE LMRxxx   Calculates the L-moment ratios of the distribution given
                    its parameters.

SUBROUTINE PELxxx   Calculates the parameters of the distribution given its
                    L-moments.  When the L-moments are the sample L-moments of
                    a set of data, then the resulting parameters are of course
                    the "method of L-moments" estimates of the parameters.

Here xxx is a 3-letter code that identifies the distribution, as follows:

  EXP     Exponential distribution
  GAM     Gamma distribution
  GEV     Generalized extreme-value distribution
  GLO     Generalized logistic distribution
  GNO     Generalized Normal (lognormal) distribution
  GPA     Generalized Pareto distribution
  GUM     Gumbel distribution
  KAP     Kappa distribution
  NOR     Normal distribution
  PE3     Pearson type III distribution
  WAK     Wakeby distribution

For example, the cumulative distribution function of the Gumbel distribution is
FUNCTION CDFGUM.



ROUTINES FOR COMPUTING SAMPLE L-MOMENTS
---------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE SAMLMR   Calculates the sample L-moment ratios of a data set,
                    via the probability weighted moments.

SUBROUTINE SAMLMU   Calculates the "unbiased" sample L-moment ratios of a data
                    set, by a more direct method.

SUBROUTINE SAMPWM   Calculates the sample probability weighted moments of a
                    data set.



ROUTINES FOR REGIONAL FREQUENCY ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------

SUBROUTINE CLUAGG   Performs cluster analysis by one of several agglomerative
                    hierarchical methods: single-link, complete-link, and
                    Ward's procedure.

SUBROUTINE CLUINF   Obtains information about clusters arising from
                    agglomerative hierarchical clustering.

SUBROUTINE CLUKM    Performs cluster analysis by the K-means algorithm.

SUBROUTINE REGLMR   Calculates regional weighted averages of L-moment ratios.

SUBROUTINE REGTST   Calculates statistics useful in regional frequency
                    analysis: discordancy measures, heterogeneity measures
                    and goodness-of-fit measures, described in more detail
                    by Hosking and Wallis (1997).

PROGRAM XCLUST      Program to illustrate the use of the cluster analysis
                    routines.

PROGRAM XFIT        Program to illustrate the use of routine REGLMR.  The
                    program performs frequency analysis of a regional data set
                    using an index-flood procedure and the method of L-moments.

PROGRAM XTEST       Program to illustrate the use of routine REGTST.  The
                    program uses REGTST to calculate test statistics for a
                    regional data set.

PROGRAM XSIM        Program to illustrate the use of Monte Carlo simulation to
                    derive the properties of estimated quantiles in regional
                    frequency analysis.
